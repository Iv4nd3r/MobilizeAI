# MobilizeAI
MobilizeAI is an AI Weather App designed to help you mobilize based on weather conditions.

## Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Iv4nd3r/MobilizeAI.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd MobilizeAI
```
Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm start: Runs the app in the development mode.
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
```
npm test: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.
```
```
npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
```
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about deployment for more information.
```
npm run eject: If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
```
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
