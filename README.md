## Features

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) App Router
- React Server Components (RSCs), Suspense, and Server Actions
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) for streaming chat UI
- Integration with Google Gemini and OpenWeather API for AI-powered weather forecasting
- Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Icons from [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com)
- Session storage with [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/storage/kv)
- [NextAuth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) for authentication

## Model Providers

This template ships with Google Gemini `models/gemini-1.0-pro-001` as the default. However, thanks to the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), or using [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the AIWeather to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-title=AIWeather&demo-description=A+full-featured%2C+hackable+Next.js+AI+weather+forecasting+built+by+Vercel+Labs&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Faiweather.vercel.ai%2F&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F4aVPvWuTmBvzM5cEdRdqeW%2F4234f9baf160f68ffb385a43c3527645%2FCleanShot_2023-06-16_at_17.09.21.png&project-name=AIWeather&repository-name=aiweather&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Faiweather&from=templates&skippable-integrations=1&env=GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY%2CAUTH_SECRET&envDescription=How+to+get+these+env+vars&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Faiweather%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&teamCreateStatus=hidden&stores=[{%22type%22:%22kv%22}])

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run AIWeather. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various Google Cloud and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
